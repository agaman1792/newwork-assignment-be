# Data services

Each entity provided in the Data model will have its own service

* The services will be stored in their own domain directory, for instance
    * If we have an entity called User (a single word)
        * It will be placed inside the src/users directory
        * The file name will be user.service.ts
    * If we have an entity called ShoppingCart (multiple words)
        * It will be placed inside the src/shopping-carts directory
        * The file name will be shopping-cart.service.ts
